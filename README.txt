===========

The agilegeo module contains several common geophysics functions
used for modelling and post-processing seismic reflection data.

The code is organized into 3 modules:
avo - Contains reflectivity models and time to depth conversions.
attribute - Contains attribute operators energy, similarity, 
            spectral decomposition, dip steering.
wavelet - Generates ricker, ormsby, fm sweep wavelets.
